## Introduction

Have you ever looked at a delicious dish and wondered what is the recipe? There are times when we come across food and do not know exactly what itâ€™s called but would like to know how to make it. Our app can remedy this! With our app, users can take pictures of their food and our page will display recipes associated with the image. Users also have the option to connect with each other by displaying their favorite recipes in public recipe lists on their profiles.

## User Roles

- Guest: an anonymous user who is able to search for recipes via image or text but cannot save those recipes to a list without creating a profile and logging in. 
- App User: people who use the app to search for recipes via image or text and save/create recipes on their profile.
- Admin: moderator who has the previlage to regulate users while being able to do all the things an app user can do.

## Third-Party APIs

We combine the features of the BigOven recipe API and the Google Cloud Vision API to provide for an easy to access food classification webapp. Users can have 2 methods of inputting parameters. They can search directly for recipes based on food or food attributes. They can also input an image to gain classification information of the food then search for its information.
